	<h4>Show Me▾</h4>
	<p style="display: none;">The boxed moved. That was a problem. Peter had packed the box three hours before and there was nothing inside that should make it move. The question now was whether or not Peter was going to open it up and look inside to see why it had moved. The answer to that question was obvious. Peter dropped the package into the mailbox so he would never have to see it again.<p>

    		let ans = four*three;
    		alert(ans);
